Multiple Iconify icon packs are available as npm packages with Astro `Icon` components. Each pack has its own import and uses the same `name`-based API.

## Pack Comparison

| Pack | Prefix | Icons | Style | Best For | Page |
|------|--------|-------|-------|----------|------|
| Material Design | `mdi` | 7,638 | Filled + outlined | General-purpose, broadest coverage | [Material Design](/mdi/) |
| Carbon | `carbon` | 2,582 | Outlined | Enterprise/IBM design, clean lines | [Carbon](/carbon/) |
| Phosphor | `ph` | 9,161 | Multiple weights | Flexible weight options (thin to fill) | [Phosphor](/phosphor/) |
| Tabler | `tabler` | 6,034 | Stroke-based | Crisp line icons, consistent stroke | [Tabler](/tabler/) |

## Usage

Each pack has its own `Icon.astro` component:

```astro
---
import MdiIcon from '@f5xc-salesdemos/icons-mdi/Icon.astro';
import CarbonIcon from '@f5xc-salesdemos/icons-carbon/Icon.astro';
import PhIcon from '@f5xc-salesdemos/icons-phosphor/Icon.astro';
import TablerIcon from '@f5xc-salesdemos/icons-tabler/Icon.astro';
---

<MdiIcon name="database" />
<CarbonIcon name="cloud" />
<PhIcon name="globe" />
<TablerIcon name="shield" />
```

Icons render as inline SVGs using `currentColor` — they automatically adapt to light and dark mode.

## Choosing a Pack

- **Broadest coverage**: Material Design Icons has the most icons (7,638) with filled and outlined variants for virtually every use case.
- **Enterprise design**: Carbon follows IBM's design language with clean, consistent outlines suited for business applications.
- **Weight flexibility**: Phosphor provides six weight variants (thin, light, regular, bold, fill, duotone) for fine-tuning visual weight.
- **Consistent strokes**: Tabler uses a uniform 2px stroke width across all 6,034 icons for a cohesive look.
